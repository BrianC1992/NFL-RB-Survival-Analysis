# NFL-RB-Survival-Analysis
The purpose of this project was to determine the career lifetime survival function curves for NFL running backs.  This was done using Kaplan-Meier Estimation which is a non-parametric technique.  Additionally, Cox Regression was used to model the factors affecting the hazard function for running backs.  
The results from this are as follows:  
1) The median career length for an RB is ~3 years.  
2) Starting age is critical in determing the possible career length of a running back.  The younger a running back is when he starts, the longer the median career length.  
3) The number of rushing attempts, receiving yards/passes caught, and starting age increases the risk of being cut from an NFL team or early retirement.  
4) The total number of passes caught, the number of rushing and receiving TD's and the number of rushing yards/attempt will decrease the risk of being cut from a team or retiring early.
